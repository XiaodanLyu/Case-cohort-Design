We conduct a statistical simulation to case-cohort design and compare its efficiency against simple random sampling. We generated sample data from Exponential and Weibull distribution. Cox proportional model is frequently used for simple randomly sampled survival data, while weighted Cox proportional model (Self and Prentice, 1988) is designed for biased sampling like case-cohort design. Besides, we applied the methodology to the data from the third and fourth clinical trials of the US National Wilms Tumor Study Group (NWTSG). Histology and tumor stage end up being the significant predictors for relapse. In the end, we computed the relative risk among different levels of these factors.
